## C# Switch Statement

![switch_statement](../../../assets/images/switch%20state.png)

Use the "switch" statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

The switch allows for a more readable branching structure because it is single level.

- It does an equality comparison (either on ints, or char or string) and then control is transferred to the matching label.
- Pattern matching is possible.
- There is a default to catch everything else.

- Each switch statement contains one or more case labels.
- All the case labels must be different.
- Label must be constant or literal.
- The default case is optional but recommended.
- Each case must end with a break statement.
- Switch can also work with enums.

> <u>Syntax</u>
>
> ```
> switch(<<integral/char/string expression>>)
> {
>   case <<value 1>>:
>     <<code block>>
>     break;
>   case <<value 2>>:
>     <<code block>>
>     break;
>   default:
>     <<code block>>
>     break;
> }
> ```

This is how it works:

- The "switch" expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each "case".
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

```
int day = 4;

switch (day)
{
  case 1:
    Console.WriteLine("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    Console.WriteLine("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    Console.WriteLine("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    Console.WriteLine("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    Console.WriteLine("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    Console.WriteLine("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    Console.WriteLine("Sunday");
    break;
}
// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)
```

```
Console.Write("Enter a number: ");

int input = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
int remainder = input % 5;

switch (remainder)
{
  case 0:
    Console.WriteLine("Multiple of five");
    break;
  default:
    Console.WriteLine("Not a multiple of five");
    break;
}
```

```
Console.Write("Enter a letter: ");

char letter = Convert.ToChar(Console.ReadLine());

switch (letter)
{
  case 'A‚Äô:
    Console.WriteLine("Apple");
    break;
  case 'B‚Äô:
  case 'C‚Äô:
    Console.WriteLine("Baby or Candy");
    break;
  default:
    Console.WriteLine("Sorry I don't know that letter");
    break;
}
```

## The break Keyword

When C# reaches a "break" keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.

When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.

A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.

## The default Keyword

The "default" keyword is optional and specifies some code to run if there is no case match:

```
int day = 4;
switch (day)
{
  case 6:
    Console.WriteLine("Today is Saturday.");
    break;
  case 7:
    Console.WriteLine("Today is Sunday.");
    break;
  default:
    Console.WriteLine("Looking forward to the Weekend.");
    break;
}
// Outputs "Looking forward to the Weekend."
```

- The "switch statement" is simple to code and more readable than the corresponding "if statement".
- Although switch is more readable, it is less powerful than the if-else statement, because it does not work with "relational expression" such as those using the[ <, <=, > and >= ] operators.
- Switch is useful when only equality comparisons are needed such as a menu system or checking for a limited number of choices.
- The break statement at the end of each case is mandatory.
