## Problem

> Create a program that calculates and displays the average of three numbers. The user will enter the three numbers.
> <br> Sample calculation:
>
> 1. Sum = first + second + third &rarr; 9 + 7 + 5 = 21
> 2. Average = sum / 3 &rarr; 21 /3

### 3 Column IPO Chart

| Input                | Processing                                | Output  |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------ |
| first, second, third | sum                                       | average |
|                      | Algorithm                                 |         |
|                      | 1. Enter first, second and third          |         |
|                      | 2. Calculate sum = first + second + third |         |
|                      | 3. Calculate average = sum / 3            |         |
|                      | 4. Display average                        |         |

## Solution

### 2 Column IPO Chart:

IPO Chart &rarr; C# Statements

- Input: first, second, third

  ```
  // Input
  int first;
  int second;
  int third;

  /* int is a keyword that is used to declare a variable which can store an integral type of value (signed integer) the range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. It is an alias of System. */
  ```

- Processing: sum
  ```
  // Processing
  int sum;
  ```
- Output: average
  ```
  // Output
  int average;
  ```
- Algorithm

  - Prompt for first

    ```
    Console.Write("Enter the first number");
    ```

  - Accept first

    ```
    first = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
    ```

  - Prompt for second

    ```
    Console.Write("Enter the second number");
    ```

  - Accept second

    ```
    second = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
    ```

  - Prompt for third

    ```
    Console.Write("Enter the third number");
    ```

  - Accept third

    ```
    third = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
    ```

  - Calculate sum = first + second + third

    ```
    sum = first + second + third;
    ```

  - Calculate average = sum / 3

    ```
    average = sum / 3;
    ```

  - Display average

        ```
        Console.Write(average);
        ```
