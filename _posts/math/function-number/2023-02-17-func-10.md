## Special Kinds of Linear Equations

| Type          | Number of Solutions                       | Final Line When Solving                       |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Conditional   | One                                       | Final line is x = a number                    |
| Identity      | Infinite; solution set {all real numbers} | Final line is True statement, such as 0 = 0.  |
| Contradiction | None; solution set ‚àÖ                      | Final line is False statement, such as 0 = 1. |

### <u>Example: Conditional</u>

Solve 5x - 9 = 4(x - 3).

| Solution                   |                       |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| 5x - 9 = 4(x - 3)          | Original equation     |
| 5x - 9 = 4x - 12           | Distributive property |
| 5x - 9 - 4x = 4x - 12 - 4x | Subtract 4x           |
| x - 9 = -12                | Combine like terms    |
| x - 9 + 9 = -12 + 9        | Add 9                 |
| x = -3                     | Solution set {-3}     |

The solution set has one element, so 5x - 9 = 4(x - 3) is a "conditional equation".

### <u>Example: Identity</u>

Solve 5x - 15 = 5(x - 3).

| Solution           |                        |
| :----------------- | :--------------------- |
| 5x - 15 = 5(x - 3) | Original equation      |
| 5x - 15 = 5x - 15  | Distributive property  |
| 0 = 0              | Subtract 5x and add 15 |

The final line, 0=0, indicates that the solution set is {all real numbers}, and the equation 5x - 15 = 5(x - 3) is an "identity". (Note: The first step yielded 5x - 15 = 5x - 15, which is true for all values of x, implying an identity there.)

### <u>Example: Contradiction</u>

Solve 5x - 15 = 5(x - 4).

| Solution                    |                       |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| 5x - 15 = 5(x - 4)          | Original equation     |
| 5x - 15 = 5x - 20           | Distributive property |
| 5x - 15 - 5x = 5x - 20 - 5x | Subtract 5x           |
| -15 = -20                   | False                 |

Because the result, -15 = -20, is false, the equation has no solution. The solution set is ‚àÖ, and the equation is a "contradiction".

## Literal Equations and Formulas

An equation involving variables (or letters), such as cx+d=e, is called a "literal equation". The most useful examples of literal equations are formulas. The solution of a problem in algebra often depends on the use of a mathematical statement or "formula" in which more than one letter is used to express a relationship.

### <u>Examples of formulas</u>

![ExFormulas](../../../assets/images/ExFormulas.png)

In some cases, a formula must be solved for one of its variables. This process is called "solving for a specified variable". The steps used are similar to those used in solving linear equations.

### <u>Solving for a Specified Variable</u>

When you are solving for a specified variable, the key is to treat that variable as if it were the only one. Treat all other variables like numbers (constants).
{: .notice--info}

- Step 1
  : If the equation contains fractions, multiply both sides by the LCD to clear the fractions.
- Step 2
  : Transform so that all terms with the specified variable are on one side and all terms without that variable are on the other side.
  : If necessary, use the distributive property to combine the terms with the specified variable.
- Step 3
  : Divide each side by the factor that is the coefficient of the specified variable. (Divide both sides by the factor that is multiplied by the specified variable.)

### <u>Example: Solving for a Specified Variable</u>

Solve the formula "P = 2L + 2W" for L.

| Solution                                    |                    |
| :------------------------------------------ | :----------------- |
| P ‚Äì 2W = 2L + 2W ‚Äì 2W                       | Subtract 2W        |
| P ‚Äì 2W = 2L                                 | Combine like terms |
| $${P ‚Äì 2W} \over {2}$$ = $${2L} \over {2}$$ | Divide by 2        |

The result is

- $$ {P ‚Äì 2W} \over {2} $$ = L
- $$ {P} \over {2} $$ - W = L

## Models

An equation or an inequality that expresses a relationship among various quantities is an example of a "mathematical model". The relationship between the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales is an example of a linear model.

A mathematical model is an equation (or inequality) that describes the relationship between two quantities. A linear model is a linear equation.

### <u>Example: Using the Formulas for Fahrenheit and Celsius</u>

The relationship between degrees Celsius (C) and degrees Fahrenheit (F) is "modeled by the linear equation" "F = 1.8C + 32."

What Celsius degree corresponds to a Fahrenheit reading of 50¬∞F?

| Solution                             |                |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------- |
| Because F = 50, the equation becomes | 50 = 1.8C + 32 |
| 500 = 18C + 320                      | Multiply by 10 |
| 180 = 18C                            | Subtract 320   |
| C = 10                               | Divide by 18   |

Therefore, a reading of "50 degrees Fahrenheit" corresponds to a reading of "10 degrees Celsius".
