## Definiton and the Fundatmental Property

### <u>Rational Numbers</u>

Rational numbers = {
$$ {x \over x} $$
is a quotient of two integers, with denominator not 0}

### <u>Fundamental Property of Rational Numbers</u>

If a, b, and k are integers with b‚â†0 and k‚â†0, then the following holds true

> $$ {(a*k) \over (b*k)} $$ \= $$ {a \over b} $$

> Q. Write
> $$ {36 \over 54} $$
> in lowest terms
>
> A.
> $$ {36 \over 54} $$ \= $$ {(18*2) \over (18*3)} $$ \= $$ {2 \over 3} $$

- A rational number is in lowest terms if the greatest common factor of the numerator (top number) and the denominator (bottom number) is 1
- Rational numbers are written in lowest terms using the following property

### <u>Cross-Product Test for Equality of Rational Numbers</u>

[Cross-Product Test](https://study.com/learn/lesson/cross-product-method-properties-steps.html)

For rational numbers
$$ {a \over b} $$
and
$$ {c \over d} $$
, where b‚â†0, d‚â†0, the following holds true

> $$ {a \over b} $$ \= $$ {c \over d} $$
> if and only if a*d = b*c

- If the product of the **‚Äúextremes‚Äù(a and d)** equals the product of the **‚Äúmeans‚Äù(b and c)**, the fractions are equal &rarr; This is the cross-product test

<br>

## Operations with Rational Numbers

### <u>Adding and Subtracting Rational Numbers</u>

If
$$ {a \over b} $$
and 
$$ {c \over d} $$
are rational numbers, then the following hold true

> $$ {a \over b} $$ \+ $$ {c \over d} $$ \= $$ {(ad+bc) \over (bd)} $$
> and 
> $$ {a \over b} $$ \- $$ {c \over d} $$ \= $$ {(ad-bc) \over (bd)} $$

- This formal definition is seldom used in practice
- We usually first rewrite the fractions with the least common multiple of their denominators, called the least common denominator (LCD)
- [LCD Calculator - Least Common Denominator](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/lcd.php)

### <u>Conversions Involving Mixed Numbers</u>

Fractions that are greater than 1 may be expressed in mixed number form

> The mixed number form of
> $$ {3 \over 2} $$
> is 1 
> $$ {1 \over 2} $$
>
> E.g. 2
> $$ {5 \over 8} $$
> to a fraction &rarr;
> $$ {16 \over 8} $$ \+ $$ {5 \over 8} $$ \= $$ {21 \over 8} $$
>
> E.g. $$ {86 \over 5} $$ to a mixed number &rarr; 17
> $$ {1 \over 5} $$
>
> (The **quotient** is the **whole number** part of the mixed number, The **remainder** is the **numerator** of the fraction part, while the **divisor** is the **denominator**)

- The whole number part and the fraction part of a mixed number are added (even though no addition symbol is shown)

### <u>Multiplying Rational Numbers</u>

If
$$ {a \over b} $$
and
$$ {c \over d} $$
are rational numbers, then the following holds true

> $$ {a \over b} $$ \* $$ {c \over d} $$ \= $$ {ac \over bd} $$

- A multiplication problem such as this is often solved by using <u>slash marks(/)</u> to indicate that common factors have been divided out of the numerator and denominator

### <u>Definition of Division</u>

If a and b are real numbers, where b‚â†0, then the following holds true

> $$ {a \over b} $$ \= a \* $$ {1 \over b} $$

- A fraction bar indicates the operation of division - The multiplicative inverse of the nonzero number b is
  $$ {1 \over b} $$
  &rarr; We define division using the multiplicative inverse
- To divide fractions, invert the divisor and multiply

### <u>Dividing Rational Numbers</u>

If
$$ {a \over b} $$
and
$$ {c \over d} $$
are rational numbers, where
$$ {c \over d} $$ ‚â† 0, then the following holds true

> $$ {a \over b} $$ / $$ {c \over d} $$ \= $$ {a \over b} $$ \* $$ {d \over c} $$ \= $$ {ad \over bc} $$

## Density and the Arithmetic Mean

There is no integer between two consecutive integers, such as 3 and 4. However, a rational number can always be found between any two distinct rational numbers. For this reason, the set of rational numbers is said to be dense.

### <u>Density Property of the Rational Numbers</u>

If **r** and **t** are distinct rational numbers, with r<t, then there exists a rational number **s** such that

> r < s < t

- There are infinitely many rational numbers between two distinct rational numbers
- One example of a rational number that is between two distinct rational numbers is the arithmetic mean of the two numbers
  - To find the arithmetic mean, or average, of n numbers, we add the numbers and then divide the sum by n
  - For two numbers, the number that lies halfway between them on a number line is their average.

## [Decimal](https://www.splashlearn.com/math-vocabulary/decimals/decimal) Form of Rational Numbers

- Rational numbers can be expressed as decimals
- Decimal numerals have place val-ues that are powers of 10

> <u>Terminating decimal</u>
>
> - A decimal such as 0.375, which stops, is called a **terminating decimal**

> <u>Repeating decimal</u>
>
> - A decimal such as 0.36..., which continues indefinitely, is called a **repeating decimal** &rarr; To indicate this, we write a bar (called a **vinculum** over the "block" of digits that repeats

- While we distinguish between terminating and repeating decimals in this text, some mathematicians prefer to consider all rational numbers as repeating decimals. This can be justified by thinking this way: If the division process leads to a remain-der of 0, then zeros repeat without end in the decimal form.
- By considering the possible remainders that may be obtained when converting a quotient of integers to a decimal, we can draw an important conclusion about
  the decimal form of rational numbers. If the remainder is never zero, the division will produce a repeating decimal. This happens because each step of the division process must produce a remainder that is less than the divisor. Since the number of different possible remainders is less than the divisor, the remainders must even-tually begin to repeat. This makes the digits of the quotient repeat, producing a
  repeating decimal.

### <u>Decimal Representation of Rational Number</u>

Any rational number can be expressed as either a terminating decimal or a repeating decimal

### <u>Criteria for Terminating and Repeating Decimals</u>

- A rational number
  $$ {a \over b} $$
  in lowest terms results in a terminating decimal if the only prime factor of the denominator is 2 or 5 (or both)
- A rational number
  $$ {a \over b} $$
  in lowest terms results in a repeating decimal if a prime other than 2 or 5 appears in the prime factorization of the denominator.
- Must a terminating decimal or a repeating decimal represent a rational number? &rarr; The answer is yes.
