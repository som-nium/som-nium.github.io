# Terminology

If the value of the variable y depends on the value of the variable x, the y is the dependent variable and x the independent variable.

# 1-1. Relations

A relation is a set of ordered pairs.

For example, the sets

- F = {(1, 2), (‚Äì1, 5), (4, 3)}
- G = {(1, 5), (9, 0), (9, 8)}

&rarr; Both F and G are relations!

<br>

# 1-2. Functions

A function is a relation in which for each value of the first component of the ordered pairs there is exactly one value of the second component.

Of the two sets,

- F = {(1, 2), (‚Äì1, 5), (4, 3), (2, 5)}
- G = {(1, 5), (9, 0), (9, 8)}

&rarr; Only F is a function and G is a just relation!

- Because only F is a function because each x value has only one y value. G is a relation since x = 9 is having more than one y value; y = 0 and 8.
- Note for function F, two x = -1 and 2 have y = 5. So, in a Function multiple x can have same y, but a single x can‚Äôt have multiple y.

## Example: Determining Independent and Dependent Variables

Determine the independent and dependent variables for the following. The procedure by which someone uses a calculator that finds square roots; y =
$$ \sqrt {x} $$

<u>Solution</u>

- The independent variable (input) is a nonnegative real number; x.
- The dependent variable (output) is the positive principal square root; y.
- y value DEPENDS on our selected value for x.
- For example (81, 9) belongs to this function.

<br>

# 2. Domain and Range

In a relation, the set of all values of the independent variable (x) is the domain.

The set of all values of the dependent variable (y) is the range.

## Example: Determining Domain and Range

Give the domain and range of y =
$$ \sqrt {x} $$

<u>Solution</u>

- The domain (x) is restricted to the nonnegative numbers: [0, ‚àû)
- The range (y) also is only the principal positive root: [0, ‚àû)

<br>

# 3. Graphs of Relations

- The graph of a relation is the graph of its ordered pairs.
- The graph gives a picture of the relation, which can be used to determine its domain and range.

## Example: Determining Domain and Range 1

## Example: Determining Domain and Range 2

![DeterminingDomainRange2](../../../assets/images/DeterminingDomainRange2.png)

> Agreement on Domain
>
> The domain of a relation is assumed to be all real numbers that produce real numbers when substituted for the independent variable.

<br>

# 4. Graphs of Functions

- In a function, each value of x leads to only one value of y, so any vertical line drawn through the graph of a function must intersect the graph in at most one point.
- This is called the vertical line test for a function.
- If a vertical line intersects the graph of at more than one point, then it is for a relation not for a function.

## Example: Vertical Line Test

| Vertical Line Test                                                 |                                                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![VerticalLineTest1](../../../assets/images/VerticalLineTest1.png) | Not a function &rarr; The same x-value corresponds to multiple y-values |
| ![VerticalLineTest2](../../../assets/images/VerticalLineTest2.png) | Function &rarr; each x-value corresponds to only one y-value            |

## Example: Determining Whether a Relation is a Function 1

Determine whether each equation defines a function and give the domain and range. &rarr; y =
$$ \sqrt {x + 1} $$

Note that for square root function, Domain of x values must have what is under the root ‚â• 0
{: .notice--info}

<u>Solution</u>

- Yes, it is a function
- To find the domain note that x + 1 >= 0.
- The domain is [-1, ‚àû) and The range is [0, ‚àû)

## Example: Determining Whether a Relation is a Function 2

Determine whether each equation defines a function and give the domain and range. &rarr; y<sup>2</sup> = x

<u>Solution</u>

- No, it is not a function
- (16, 4) and (16, -4) both work. (In a Function, multiple x can have same y, but a single x can‚Äôt have multiple y.)
- The domain is [0, ‚àû) and The range is (-‚àû, ‚àû)

## Example: Determining Whether a Relation is a Function 3

Determine whether each equation defines a function and give the domain and range. &rarr; y <= 2x

<u>Solution</u>

- No, it is not a function
- For example, if x = 1, then any y value less than or equal to 2 would satisfy the inequality, so there are infinitely many possible y values for x = 1.
- The domain and range are (-‚àû, ‚àû)

## Example: Determining Whether a Relation is a Function 4

Determine whether each equation defines a function and give the domain and range. &rarr; y =
$$ {3} \over {x - 2} $$

Note that for fractional function, Domain of x values must have "denominator ‚â† 0"
{: .notice--info}

<u>Solution</u>

- Yes, it is a function
- The domain is (-‚àû, 2] U [2, ‚àû), since we avoid 0 in the denominator.
- The range is (-‚àû, 0] U [0, ‚àû)

# Variations of the Definition of Function

1. A function is a relation in which for each value of the first component of the ordered pairs there is exactly one value of the second component.
2. A function is a set of distinct ordered pairs in which no first component is repeated.
3. A function is a rule or correspondence that assigns exactly one range value to each domain value.

<br>

# 5. Function Notation

When a function f is defined with a rule or an equation using x and y for the independent and dependent variables, we say ‚Äúy is a function of x‚Äù to emphasize that y depends on x. We use the notation y = f (x), called function notation, to express this and read f (x) as ‚Äúf of x.‚Äù For example if y = 3x + 1, we write f(x) = 3x + 1.

- Note that f (x) is just another name for the dependent variable y.
- If f (x) = 3x + 1, we find f(2) by replacing x with 2, f(2) = 3(2) + 1 = 7
  : - Read f(2) as ‚Äúf of 2‚Äù or ‚Äúf at 2.‚Äù

## Example: Using Function Notation

Let f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> + 3x ‚Äì 1. Find the following.

- a) f(2) = 2<sup>2</sup> + 3(2) -1 = 9
- b) f(0) = 0 + 0 - 1 = -1
- c) f(2x) = (2x)<sup>2</sup> + 3(2x) - 1 = 4x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 1

<br>

# 6. Linear Functions

A function that can be written in the form f(x) = mx + b for real numbers m and b is a linear function.

## Example: Graphing Linear Functions

Graph each linear function.

# 7. Modeling with Linear Functions

## Example: Modeling with Linear Functions 1

A company produces DVDs of live concerts. The company pays $200 for advertising the DVDs. Each DVD costs $12 to produce and the company charges $20 per disk.

- a) Express the cost C as a function of x, the number of DVDs produced.

The fixed cost is $200 and for each DVD produced, the variable cost is $12. The cost C can be expressed as a function of x, the number of DVDs produced: C(x) = 12x + 200.

## Example: Modeling with Linear Functions 2

A company produces DVDs of live concerts. The company pays $200 for advertising the DVDs. Each DVD costs $12 to produce and the company charges $20 per disk.

- b) Express the revenue R as a function of x, the number of DVDs sold.

Each DVD sells for $20, so revenue R is given by: R(x) = 20x.

## Example: Modeling with Linear Functions 3

A company produces DVDs of live concerts. The company pays $200 for advertising the DVDs. Each DVD costs $12 to produce and the company charges $20 per disk.

- c) When will the company break-even? That is, for what value of x does revenue equal cost?

The company will just break even (no profit and no loss) as long as revenue just equals cost, or C(x) = R(x).

This is true whenever

- 12x + 200 = 20x
- 200 = 8x
- 25 = x.

If 25 DVDs are produced and sold, the company will break even.
