## Definition and Basic Concepts

- Every rational number has a decimal form that terminates or repeats, and every repeating or terminating decimal represents a rational number
- However, there are numbers that do not terminate and do not repeat &rarr; We call this "Irrational Numbers"

### <u>Irrational Numbers</u>

Irrational numbers = {
$$ {x \over x} $$
is a number represented by a nonrepeating, non-terminating decimal}
<br> &rarr; As the name implies, an irrational number cannot be represented as a quotient of integers

- E.g. root, the Golden Ratio, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and a constant approximately equal to 2.71828 ...

## Irrationality of root 2 and Proof by Contradiction

The proof that root 2 is irrational is a classic example of a proof by contradiction. We begin by assuming that root 2 is rational, which leads to a contradiction, or absurdity. The method is also called reductio ad absurdum (Latin for ‚Äúreduce to
the absurd‚Äù). In order to understand the proof, we consider three preliminary facts:

1. When a rational number is written in lowest terms, the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominator is 1.
2. If an integer is even, then it has 2 as a factor and may be written in the form 2k, where k is an integer.
3. If a perfect square is even, then its square root is even.

## Operations with Square Roots

- Recall that
  $$ \sqrt{a} $$
  , for a >= 0, is the nonnegative number whose square is a
- That is, {($$ \sqrt{a} $$)}^2 = a

> - Examples of square roots that are irrational: $$ \sqrt{2} $$, $$ \sqrt{3} $$, and $$ \sqrt{13} $$
>
> - Examples of square roots that are rational: $$ \sqrt{4} $$ = 2, $$ \sqrt{36} $$ = 6, and $$ \sqrt{100} $$ = 10

- If n is a positive integer that is not the square of an integer, then 2n is an irrational number.
- A calculator with a square root key can give approximations of square roots of numbers that are not perfect squares.
- We use the ‚âà symbol to indicate ‚Äúis approximately equal to.‚Äù
- Sometimes, for convenience, the = symbol is used even if the statement is actually one of approximation, such as pi = 3.14.

### <u>Product Rule for Square Roots</u>

For nonnegative real numbers a and b, the following holds true

> $$ \sqrt{a} $$ * $$ \sqrt{b} $$ \= $$ \sqrt{a*b} $$

### <u>Conditions for a Simplified Square Root Radical</u>

Just as every rational number
$$ {a \over b} $$
can be written in lowest terms (by using the fundamental property of rational numbers), every square root radical has a simplified form

> A square root radical is in simplified form if the following three conditions are met:
>
> 1. The number under the radical (radicand) has no factor (except 1) that is a perfect square
> 2. The radicand has no fractions
> 3. No denominator contains a radical

### <u>Quotient Rule for Square Roots</u>

For nonnegative real numbers a and positive real numbers b, the following holds true

> $$ {\sqrt{a} \over \sqrt{b}} $$ \=
> $$ {\sqrt{$$ {a \over b} $$}} $$

### <u>Adding and Subtracting Square Root Radicals</u>

- Square root radicals may be combined, however, if they have the same radicand. Such radicals are called like radicals. We add (and subtract) like radicals using the distributive property.
- Like radicals may be added or subtracted by adding or subtracting their coef-ficients (the numbers by which they are multiplied) and keeping the same radical.

## Exercise

### Section 6.4: 7 ~ 19 (odd)

<u>Identify each number as rational or irrational</u>

- 7: 4/9 &rarr; rational
- 9: root 10 &rarr; irrational
- 11: 1.618 &rarr; rational
- 13: 0.41 (repeating 41) &rarr; rational
- 15: Pi &rarr; irrational
- 17: 3.14159 &rarr; rational
- 19: 0.878778777877778... &rarr; irrational

### Section 6.4: 23 ~ 29 (odd)

<u>Use a calculator to find a rational decimal approximation for each irrational number</u>

- 23: root 39 &rarr; 6.244 997 998 4
- 25: root 15.1 &rarr; 3.885 871 845 55
- 27: root 884 &rarr; 29.732 137 494 6
- 29: root 9/8 &rarr; 1.060 660 171 78

### Section 6.4: 49 ~ 67 (odd)

<u>Use the methods of Examples 3 and 4 to simplify each expression. Then, use a calculator to approximate both the given expression and the simplified expression. (Both should be the same.)</u>

- 49: root 50 &rarr; 5(root 2) &rarr; 7.071 067 811 87
- 51: root 75 &rarr; 5(root 3) &rarr; 8.660 254 037 84
- 53: root 288 &rarr; 12(root 2) &rarr; 16.970 562 748 5
- 55: 5/(root 6) &rarr; 5/6(root 6) &rarr; 2.041 241 452 32
- 57: root (7/4) &rarr; (root 7)/2 &rarr; 1.322 875 655 53
- 59: root (7/3) &rarr; (root 21)/3 &rarr; 1.527 525 231 65

<u>Use the method of Example 5 to perform the indicated operations</u>

- 61: root 17 + 2(root 17) &rarr; 3(root 17)
- 63: 5(root 7) - root 7 &rarr; 4(root 7)
- 65: 3(root 18) + root 2 &rarr; 10(root 2)
- 67: -(root 12) + root 75 &rarr; 3(root 3)
