# Exponential and Logarithmic Functions, Applications, and Models

# 1. Exponential Functions and Applications

An exponential function with base b, where b > 0 and b != 1, is a function of the form f(x) = b<sup>x</sup>, where x is any real number.

## Example: Graph of Exponential Function (b > 1)

## Example: Graph of Exponential Function (0 < b < 1)

<br>

# 1 - A. Graph of f(x) = b<sup>x</sup>

1. The graph always will contain the point (0, 1).
2. When b > 1, the graph will rise from left to right.
   When 0 < b < 1, the graph will fall from left to
   right.
3. The x-axis is the horizontal asymptote.
4. The domain is (-‚àû, ‚àû) and the range is (0, ‚àû).

# 1 - C. Compound Interest Formula

Suppose that a principal of P dollars is invested at an annual interest rate r (in percent, expressed as a decimal), compounded n times per year. Then the amount A accumulated after t years is given by the formula

A = P(1 +
$$ {r} \over {n} $$
)<sup>nt</sup>

## Example: Compound Interest Formula

Suppose that $2000 dollars is invested at an annual rate of 8%, compounded quarterly. Find the total amount in the account after 6 years if no withdrawals are made.

| Solution                                              |
| :---------------------------------------------------- |
| A = P(1 + $$ {r} \over {n} $$)<sup>nt</sup>           |
| A = 2000(1 + $$ {0.08} \over {4} $$)<sup>4(6)</sup>   |
| A = 2000(1.02)<sup>24</sup> ‚âà 2000(1.60844) = 3216.88 |

There would be $3216.88 in the account at the end of six years.

<br>

# 1 - D. Continuous Compound Interest Formula

Suppose that a principal of P dollars is invested at an annual interest rate r (in percent, expressed as a decimal), compounded continuously. Then the amount A accumulated after t years is given by the formula

A = Pe<sup>rt</sup>.

## Example: Continuous Compound Interest Formula

Suppose that $2000 dollars is invested at an annual rate of 8%, compounded continuously. Find the total amount in the account after 6 years if no withdrawals are made.

| Solution                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------- |
| A = Pe<sup>rt</sup>                                |
| A = 2000e<sup>0.08(6)</sup>                        |
| A = 2000e<sup>0.48</sup> ‚âà 2000(1.61607) = 3232.14 |

There would be $3232.14 in the account at the end of six years.

<br>

# 1 - E. Doubling Time Formula

Time needed to double an initial amount as an exponential function: A = Pe<sup>rt</sup>

- A: is present amount
- P: is future amount after t years
- r: is annual compounding rate

## Example: Doubling Time

Suppose that a certain amount P is invested at an annual rate of 5% compounded continuously. How long will it take for the amount to double (doubling time)?

| Solution                             |                          |
| :----------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| A = Pe<sup>rt</sup>                  | Formula                  |
| 2P = Pe<sup>0.05t</sup>              | Sub in 2P for A (double) |
| 2 = e<sup>0.05t</sup>                | Divide by P              |
| ln2 = ln e<sup>0.05t</sup>           | Take ln of both sides    |
| ln2 = 0.05t                          | Simplify                 |
| t = $$ {ln 2} \over {0.05} $$ ‚âà 13.9 | Divide by 0.05           |

Therefore, it would take about 13.9 years for the initial investment P to double.

# 2. Logarithmic Functions and Applications

A logarithmic function with base b, where b > 0 and b ‚â† 1, is a function of the form

g(x) = log<sub>b</sub>x, where x > 0.

<br>

# 2 - A. Graph of g(x) = log<sub>b</sub>x

The graph of y = log<sub>b</sub>x can be found by interchanging the roles of x and y in the function as shown x = b<sup>y</sup> (Exponential Function)

## Example: Logarithmic Functions

![LogarithmicFunctions](../../../assets/images/LogarithmicFunctions.png)

<br>

# 2 - B. Characteristics of Graph g(x) = log<sub>b</sub>x

1. The graph always will contain the point (1, 0).
2. When b > 1 the graph will rise from left to right. When 0 < b < 1, the graph will fall from left to right.
3. The y-axis is the vertical asymptote.
4. The domain is (0, ‚àû) and the range is (-‚àû, ‚àû).

<br>

# 2 - C. Natural Logarithmic Function (y = ln x)

"g(x) = y = ln x" is called the natural logarithmic function.

ln x = log<sub>e</sub>x, where base e = 2.71828...

![NaturalLogarithmic](../../../assets/images/NaturalLogarithmic.png)

The expression ln e<sup>k</sup> is the exponent to which the base e must be raised in order to obtain e<sup>k</sup>. There is only one such number that will do this, and it is k. Thus for all real numbers k, ln e<sup>k</sup> = k. (e = 2.71828‚Ä¶)

<br>

# 2 - D. Models in Nature

Radioactive materials disintegrate according to exponential decay functions. The half-life of a quantity that decays exponentially is the amount of time it takes for any initial amount to decay to half its initial value.

## Example : Half-Life

Carbon 14 is a radioactive form of carbon that is found in all living plants and animals. After a plant or animal dies, the radiocarbon disintegrates. The amount of carbon 14 present after t years is modeled by the exponential equation y = y<sub>0</sub>e<sup>-0.0001216t</sup>

<u>a) What is the half-life of carbon 14?</u>

![HalfLife](../../../assets/images/HalfLife.png)

t ‚âà 5700 &rarr; The half-life of carbon 14 is about 5700 years.

<u>b) If an initial sample contains 1 gram of carbon 14, how much will be left in 10,000 years?</u>

![InitialSample](../../../assets/images/InitialSample.png)

There will be about 0.30 grams remaining.

<br>

# 3. Exponential-Logarithmic Applications (Exponential and Logarithmic Equivalents)

For b > 0 and b ‚â† 1, b<sup>y</sup> = x, then y = log<sub>b</sub>x

| Exponential Equation                  | Logarithmic Equation                     |
| :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| 3<sup>4</sup> = 81                    | 4 = log<sub>3</sub>81                    |
| 10<sup>4</sup> = 10,000               | 4 = log<sub>10</sub>10,000               |
| 4<sup>-3</sup> = $$ {1} \over {64} $$ | -3 = log<sub>4</sub>$$ {1} \over {64} $$ |
| 3<sup>0</sup> = 1                     | 0 = log<sub>3</sub>1                     |
