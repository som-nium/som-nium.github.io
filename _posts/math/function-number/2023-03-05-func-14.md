## 1. Quadratic Equations

We have considered linear equations and inequalities in earlier sections. Now we investigate second-degree, or quadratic, equations.

An equation that can be written in the form

> Standard form: ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0

where a, b, and c are real numbers, with a‚â†0, is a quadratic equation. The form of the equation given above is called standard form.

<br>

## 2. Zero-Factor Property

One method of solving a quadratic equation depends on the following property.

> If ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0 or both.

Solving a quadratic equation by the zero-factor property requires that the equation be in standard form before factoring.

### <u>Example: Zero-Factor Property</u>

Solve 6x<sup>2</sup> + 7x = 3.

| Solution                    |                        |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| 6x<sup>2</sup> + 7x = 3     | Given equation         |
| 6x<sup>2</sup> + 7x - 3 = 0 | Write in standard form |
| (3x - 1)(2x + 3) = 0        | Factor                 |
| 3x - 1 = 0 or 2x + 3 = 0    | Zero-factor property   |
| 3x = 1 or 2x = -3           | Solve each equation    |
| x = 1/3 or x = -3/2         | Divide                 |

Check. Substitute
$$ {1} \over {3} $$
and -
$$ {3} \over {2} $$
in the original equation. The solution set is {
$$ {1} \over {3} $$
, 
$$ {3} \over {2} $$
}

## 3. Square Root Property

> If k >= 0, then the solutions of x<sup>2</sup> = k are + $\sqrt {k}$ or - $\sqrt {k}$

- If k > 0, the equation x<sup>2</sup> = k has two real solutions.
- If k = 0, there is only one solution, 0.
- If k < 0, there are no real solutions &rarr; (In this last case, there are complex solutions. Complex numbers are covered in more extensive algebra texts.)

A quadratic equation of the form x<sup>2</sup> = k, k >= 0, can be solved as follows.

| Solution                           |                        |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| x<sup>2</sup> = k                  | Given equation         |
| x<sup>2</sup> - k = 0              | Subtract k             |
| (x + sqrt{k})(x - sqrt{k}) = 0     | Factor, using radicals |
| x + sqrt{k} = 0 or x - sqrt{k} = 0 | Zero-factor property   |
| x = - sqrt{k} or x = sqrt{k}       | Solve each equation    |

This leads to the square root property for solving equations.

### <u>Example: Square Root Property</u>

Solve each quadratic equation for real solutions.

a) x<sup>2</sup> = 36 &rarr; The solution set is {+6, -6}

b) (x - 1)<sup>2</sup> = 8 &rarr; The solution set is {1 + 2(sqrt{2}), 1 - 2(sqrt{2})}

c) m<sup>2</sup> = -5 &rarr; No real solutions, the solution set is ‚àÖ.

## 4. Quadratic Formula

By completing the square (see the margin note at left), we can derive one of the most important formulas in algebra, the quadratic formula.

The solution of $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$, $a \ne 0$, are given by the quadratic formula.

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
