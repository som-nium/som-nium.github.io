> ## Objectives
>
> 1. A number on a number line
> 2. A number as positive, negative, or zero
> 3. A number as belonging to one or more sets of numbers
> 4. Given 2 numbers A and B, determine whether A = B, A < B, or A > B
> 5. Given a number A, determine its additive inverse and absolute value
> 6. Signed numbers in tables of economic and occupations data

## Sets of Real Numbers

### 1. Natural Numbers

{1, 2, 3, 4, ...} is the set of **natural numbers**
<br> &rarr; Numbers which we can count

### 2. Whole Numbers

{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...} is the set of **whole numbers**
<br> &rarr; Including 0

### 3. Number Line

> [Number Line Image Link](https://d138zd1ktt9iqe.cloudfront.net/media/seo_landing_files/number-line-negative-and-positive-1634275662.png)
>
> - Origin: "0"
> - The right of "0": Positive numbers {1, 2, 3, ...}
> - The left of "0": Negative numbers {-1, -2, -3, ...}

- Signed numbers: Positive numbers and Negative numbers
- "0" itself: Neither positive nor negative
- Practical applications of negative numbers: Temperatures, Altitude below sea level

[Signed and Unsigned Numbers](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-digital/9780470900550/chap2-sec009.html)
<br> [Signed vs Unsigned](https://www.scaler.com/topics/sql/signed-vs-unsigned/)

> Difference between Signed and Unsigned in MySQL
>
> - Signed value - Variables with signed numerals can store 0, positive, and negative numbers.
> - Unsigned value - Variables with unsigned numerals can store only 0 and positive numbers.

### 4. Integers

{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} is the set of **integers**
<br> &rarr; The **natural numbers**, **negative numbers**, and **zero** make up the set of integers.

- An integer, such as 2, is also a rational number &rarr; 2 = 2/1

### 5. Rational Numbers

{x/x is a quotient of two integers, with denominator not equal to 0} is the set of **rational numbers**

- The set symbolism used in the definition of rational numbers: {x/x has a certain property} &rarr; Set-builder notation
- [Set-builder notation](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/set-builder-notation/)
- [Set-builder notation(KR)](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%A1%B0%EA%B1%B4%EC%A0%9C%EC%8B%9C%EB%B2%95)

### 6. Irrational Numbers

[Irrational numbers Image Link](https://dr282zn36sxxg.cloudfront.net/datastreams/f-d%3A6135a328362aee3038e9ccb838d7a943e17533a586ef80478b109a93%2BIMAGE_TINY%2BIMAGE_TINY.1)

{x/x is a number on the number line that is not rational} is the set of **irrational numbers**
<br> &rarr; Cannot be expressed as <u>a quotient of integers (a fraction of integer over integer)</u>

[Pi œÄ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi)
<br> [Pi œÄ Image Link](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3ffc6970dda2e60597854f14e2ac1e13a25a5cf)

### 7. Real Numbers

{x/x is a number that can be represented by a point on a number line} is the set of **real numbers**
<br> &rarr; Can be written as decimal numbers

- Rational numbers: Can be written as a decimal that will either come to end(terminate) or repeat in a fixed "block" of digits
  - Terminating decimals: 2/5 = 0.4
  - Repeating decimals: 3/11 = 0.2727272727......
- Irrational numbers: Neither terminates nor repeats

## Order in the Real Numbers

### 1. [Law of Trichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_trichotomy)

For any real numbers A and B, one and only one of the following holds true
<br> {A = B, A < B, A > B}

[Inequality (Mathematics)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_(mathematics)>)

### 2. [Additive Inverse](https://byjus.com/maths/additive-inverse/) and Absolute Value

> **Additive Inverse**
>
> For any non-zero real number x, there is exactly one number on the number line the same distance from 0 as x but on the opposite side of 0
> <br> &rarr; {3, -3} is called **additive inverses**, **negatives**, or **opposites** of each other
>
> - The additive inverse of the number 0 is 0 itself
> - Double negative rule: For any number x, the following holds true &rarr; {-(-x) = x}

> **Absolute Value**
>
> [Absolute Value Image Link](https://files.realpython.com/media/abs_pieceswise.850458ee3c6a.png)
>
> - The absolute value of a real number can be defined as the undirected distance between 0 and the number on a number line
> - Read "the absolute value of x"
> - The absolute value of a number is never negative
> - The absolute value of 0 &rarr; 0

### 3. Applications of Real Numbers

- Interpreting Signed Numbers in a Table: Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- Comparing Occupational Rates of Change
