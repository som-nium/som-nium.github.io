## Traits of Successful Software Engineers

- Takes responsibility for own actions.
- Cares about team members and stakeholders.
- Provides honest feedback for improvement.
- Can handle stress and challenges.
- Believes in fairness.
- Pays attention to details.
- Adapts software engineering practices as needed.

## Behavioral Model for Software Engineering

<br>

## Boundary Spanning Team Roles

Boundary Spanning Team Roles are the different ways team members work together with people outside of their own team or organization. This helps them achieve common goals and work better together.

- Ambassador: Speaks for the team to people outside the team.
- Scout: Finds out information from other teams or sources.
- Guard: Protects the team's work from unauthorized access.
- Sentry: Checks information before sharing it with the team.
- Coordinator: Helps the team communicate and work together well.

<br>

## Effective Software Team Attributes

- Sense of purpose.
- Sense of involvement.
- Sense of trust.
- Sense of improvement.
- Diversity of team member skill sets.

<br>

## Avoid Team "Toxicity"

- The team is working in a disorganized and unproductive environment.
- The team is frustrated due to conflicts caused by personal, business, or technological issues.
- The team is facing difficulties due to unclear procedures or a lack of coordination.
- The team members are not sure about their roles and responsibilities, which leads to blaming each other.
- The team's morale is low due to repeated failures and lack of confidence.

<br>

## Project Factors Affecting Team Structure

The following factors must be considered when selecting a software project team structure:

- Complexity of the project
- Size of the program(s)
- Duration of the team's collaboration
- Modularization of the problem
  : Modularization: 모듈화(큰 문제를 작은 단위로 쪼개어서 처리하기 위한 방법. 즉, 복잡한 시스템을 구성하는 부분들을 독립적인 모듈로 분리하여 개발하는 것을 의미)
- Required quality and reliability of the system
- Firmness of the delivery deadline
- Communication needs for the project

<br>

## Organizational Paradigms

1. Closed Paradigm: traditional hierarchy of authority
2. Random Paradigm: loose structure with individual initiative
3. Open Paradigm: structured for both control and innovation
4. Synchronous Paradigm: team members work on separate pieces of a problem with little communication between them

> 패러다임

> 패러다임은 어떤 분야에서 특정한 이론, 방법, 규범, 패턴 등의 모음을 의미합니다. 컴퓨터 과학 분야에서는 프로그래밍 패러다임이라는 용어로 많이 사용됩니다. 프로그래밍 패러다임은 컴퓨터 프로그래밍에서 문제를 해결하기 위해 사용되는 기본적인 방식, 스타일, 구조, 원칙 등을 의미합니다.
>
> 각 패러다임은 자신만의 특징을 가지고 있으며, 그에 따라 적합한 문제를 다루는데 있어서 각기 장단점이 있습니다. 대표적인 프로그래밍 패러다임으로는 구조적 프로그래밍, 객체지향 프로그래밍, 함수형 프로그래밍 등이 있습니다.

## Generic Agile Teams

To succeed in a project, it's important to have skilled individuals who can work well in a team. People are more important than following strict rules, and sometimes office politics can be a challenge.

Agile teams are flexible and can take on different structures. They can make their own decisions and communicate well with each other and with customers.

Planning is only done as much as needed to meet business goals and standards. It's a good idea to have a customer representative on the team to ensure everyone is on the same page.

<br>

## XP Team Values

- Communication: Talk to each other in a friendly way and use simple language. Explain things using examples or comparisons.
- Simplicity: Make things that work for what is needed right now, don't worry about things that might be needed in the future.
- Feedback: Use information from the software, customers, and others to make things better.
- Courage: Stick to the plan and don't let others change things too much.
- Respect: Be kind and polite to everyone.

<br>

## Impact of Social Media

Social media can help software engineers connect with others who have similar skills and goals. This is especially important for large or remote teams. But, privacy and security are important to consider when using social media for work. Companies need to weigh the benefits of social media against the risks of sharing confidential information.

### <u>Examples of Social Media</u>

- Blogs &rarr; can be used share information with team members and customers
- Microblogs (e.g. Twitter) &rarr; allow posting of real-time messages to individuals following the poster
- Targeted online forums &rarr; allow participants to post questions or opinions and collect answers
- Social networking sites (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn) &rarr; allows connections among software developers for the purpose of sharing information
- Social book marking (e.g. Delicious, Stumble, CiteULike) &rarr; allow developers to keep track of and share web-based resources

<br>

## Team Decision Making Complications

- The problem is complicated.
- There is a lot of uncertainty and risk involved in making a decision.
- Making a decision could have unintended consequences for another project.
- People have different opinions about what the best solution is.
- Global software teams have a harder time working together because they have to deal with communication and coordination challenges.

### <u>Factors Affecting Global Software Development Teams</u>

## Software Engineering using the Cloud

### <u>Benefits</u>

- Work anywhere: You can store and access your software engineering work from anywhere with an internet connection.
- Use any device: You can work on your software engineering project using any device with an internet connection.
- Test and share easily: You can easily distribute and test your software using cloud-based tools. You can also share information easily with your team.

Overall, using the cloud makes software engineering more flexible and collaborative.

### <u>Concerns</u>

- The cloud services used may be outside of the software team's control, which can make them less reliable and secure.
- As more and more cloud services are used, it can become difficult to ensure they all work together properly.
- Cloud services prioritize usability and performance over security, privacy, and reliability, which can lead to conflicts.

<br>

## Collaboration Tools

- Private storage for work
- Shared calendar for scheduling events
- Templates for creating consistent-looking documents
- Metrics to track each team member's progress
- Communication analysis to identify potential issues
- Artifact clustering to show how work products are related.

> Artifact clustering
>
> Artifact clustering은 작업 제품 간의 종속성을 보여주는 것입니다. 이 도구는 작업 제품이 서로 어떻게 관련되어 있는지 시각적으로 보여줍니다. 예를 들어, 여러 개의 문서, 그림 및 프로젝트 파일이 있을 때, 이러한 파일들이 어떻게 서로 연결되어 있는지 이해하기 쉬워집니다. Artifact clustering은 팀원들이 프로젝트를 이해하고 작업 제품 간의 의존성을 파악하고 관리하는 데 도움을 줍니다.
