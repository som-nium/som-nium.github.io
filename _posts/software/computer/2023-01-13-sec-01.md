## What is a Computer?

A computer is an electronic data processing device, which accepts and stores data input, processes the data input, and generates the output in a required format.

<br>

## Functionalities of a Computer

- Step 1. Take data as input
- Step 2. Store the data/instructions in its memory and Use them as required
- Step 3. Process the data and Convert it into useful information
- Step 4. Generate the output
- Step 5. Control all the above four steps

<br>

## Computer Types

- PC (Personal Computer): A PC is a single user computer system having moderately powerful microprocessor
- Workstation: A workstation is also a single user computer system, similar to a personal computer. However, it has a more powerful microprocessor
- Mini Computer: A minicomputer is a midsize multi-processing system capable of supporting up to 250 users simultaneously
- Mainframe: A mainframe is also a a multi-user computer system, but is very large in size and is an expensive computer capable of supporting hundreds or even thousands of users simultaneously
- Supercomputer: Supercomputers are one of the fastest computers currently available &rarr; Weather forecasting, Scientific simulations, (animated) Graphics, Fluid dynamic calculations, and so on

<br>

## Computer Operations

### Converting raw input data into information useful to their users

- Step 1. Take Input: Entering data and instructions into the computer system
- Step 2. Store Data: Saving data and instructions so that they are available for processing as and when required
- Step 3. Process Data: Performing arithmetic, and logical operations on data in order to convert them into useful information
- Step 4. Output Information: Producing useful information or results for the user, such as a printed report or visual display
- Step 5. Control the Workflow: Directs the manner and sequence in which all of the above operations are performed

<br>

## Computer Components

### Input Unit

- Contain device entering data into the computer
- Create a link between the user and the computer
- Translate the information into a form understandable by the computer

### CPU

CPU is considered the **brain of the computer**
<br> &rarr; Perform all types of data processing operations, such as storing data, intermediate results, and instructions (programs)
<br> &rarr; Control the operation of all parts of the computer

> **Memory Unit**
>
> - Store all the data and the instructions required for processing
> - Store intermediate results of processing
> - Store the final results of processing before these results are released to an output device
> - All inputs and outputs are transmitted through the main memory

> **Control Unit**
>
> - Control the transfer of data and instructions among other units of a computer
> - Manage and coordinate all the units of the computer
> - Obtains the instructions from the memory, Interpret them, and Direct the operation of the computer
> - Communicate with Input/Output devices for transfer of data or results from storage
> - Does not process or store data

> **Arithmetic & Logic Unit (ALU)**
>
> - Arithmetic Section: Perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
> - Logic Section: Perform logic operations such as comparing, selecting, matching, and merging of data

### Output Unit

- Consist of devices that convey the information from the computer to user
- A link between the computer and the user
- Translate the computer's output into a form understandable by the user
