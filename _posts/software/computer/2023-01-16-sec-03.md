## Date &rarr; "Process" &rarr; Information

<br>

## Data

- "Unique" raw fact
- Can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner
- Should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human or electronic machine
- Represented with the help of characters such as alphabets(A-Z, a-z), digits(0-9), or special characters(+, -, /, \*, <, >, =, etc)
- E.g. Student ID, First/Last name, Email, Phone number ...

### <u>3Vs</u>

### <u>Cloud</u>

### <u>Security</u>

[Why is data security important?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security)

<br>

## Information

- Organized or classified data, which has some meaningful values for the receiver
- Processed data on which decisions and actions are based
- Required for "Decision making"
- E.g. What is student id number?, What is phone number? ...

### <u>For the decision to be meaningful, the processed data must qualify for the following characteristics</u>

- Timely: Information should be available when required
- Accuracy: Information should be accurate
- Completeness: Information should be complete

<br>

## Information Processing Cycle

Information processing is the **re-structuring** or **re-ordering** of data by people or machine to increase their usefulness and add values for a particular purpose

### <u>Input</u>

- Input data is prepared in some convenient form for processing
- The form depends on the processing machine
- Ex) Electronic computer &rarr; The input data can be recorded on any one of the several types of input medium, such as magnetic disks, tapes, etc

### <u>Processing</u>

- Input data is changed to produce data in a more useful form
- Ex 1) Paycheques &rarr; Can be calculated from the time cards
- Ex 2) A summary of sales for the month &rarr; Can be calculated from the sales orders

### <u>Output</u>

- The results of the previous processing step is collected
- The particular form of the output data depends on the use of the data
- Ex) Output data &rarr; Paycheques for employees
