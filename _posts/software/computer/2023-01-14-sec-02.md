📋 This is my note-taking from what I learned in the class "Software Engineering Fundamentals - COMP 120-002"

## Memory

Computer memory = Human brain

- Store data and instructions
- Memory is divided into large number of small parts called "cells"
- Each location or cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one
  - Computer has 64k words
  - Memory unit has 64\*1024 = 65536 memory locations
  - The address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535

### <u>Cache Memory</u>

- Very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up the CPU(Central Processing Unit)
- Act as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory
- Hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by the CPU
- Transfer the parts of data and programs from the disk to cache memory by the operating system, from where the CPU can access them

**Advantages**

- Cache memory is faster than main memory
- Consume less access time as compared to main memory
- Store the program that can be executed within a short period of time
- Store data for temporary use

**Disadvantages**

- Cache memory has limited capacity
- Very expensive

### <u>Primary Memory (Main Memory)</u>

- Semiconductor memory
- Usually volatile memory
- A limited capacity
- Data is lost when power is switched off
- Hold only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working
- Faster than secondary memory
- Not as fast as registers
- Computer cannot run without the primary memory
- Divide into two subcategories **RAM** and **ROM**

### <u>Secondary Memory</u>

- Magnetic and optical memory
- Backup memory
- External and non-volatile memory
- Data is permanently stored even if power is switched off
- Used for storage of data in a computer
- Computer may run without the secondary memory
- Slower than primary memory
- CPU directly does not access these memories, instead they are accessed via input-output routines &rarr; the contents of secondary memories are first transferred to the main memory, and then the CPU can access it [ex) disk, CD-ROM, DVD, etc.]

<br>

## Random Access Memory (RAM)

- Internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program, and program result
- Read/Write memory which stores data until the machine is working
- As soon as the machine is switched off, data is erased
- Access time in RAM is independent of the address = Each storage location inside the memory is as easy to reach as other locations and take the same amount of time
- Data in the RAM can be accessed randomly but it is very expensive
- Volatile = Data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power failure &rarr; Backup Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) is often used with computer
- RAM is small, both in terms of physical size and the amount of data it can hold

### <u>Static RAM</u>

- Static = The memory retains its contents as long as power is being supplied, but data is lost when the power gets down
- SRAM chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and no capacitors
- Long life and Large size
- No need to refresh = Transistors do not require power to prevent leakage
- High power consumption
- Extra space in the matrix &rarr; Use more chips than DRAM for the same amount of storage space &rarr; Expensive, Faster, and Used as cache memory

### <u>Dynamic RAM</u>

- Need to be refreshed continuously to maintain the data = Done by placing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second
- Slower as compared to SRAM
- Used as RAM
- Short data lifetime
- Less expensive and Small &rarr; Used for most system memory
- Less power consumption
- All DRAMs are made up of memory cells, which are composed of one capacitor and one transistor

<br>

## Read-Only Memory (ROM)

- Only read but cannot write on it
- Non-volatile
- Store permanently in such memories during manufacture
- Store such instructions that are required to start a computer
- This operation is referred to as bootstrap
- ROM chips are not only used in the computer but also in other electronic items like washing machine and microwave ovens

**Advantages of ROM**

- Non-volatile in nature
- Cannot be accidentally changed
- Cheaper than RAMs
- Easy to test
- More reliable than RAMs
- Static and do not require refreshing
- Contents are always known and can be verified

### <u>MROM (Masked ROM)</u>

- The very first ROMs were hard-wired devices that contained a pre-programmed set of data or instructions
- Inexpensive

### <u>PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory)</u>

- Read-only memory that can be modified only once by a user
- Buy a blank PROM and Enter the desired contents using a PROM program
- Inside the PROM chip, there are small fuses which are burnt open during programming &rarr; Can be programmed only once and is not erasable

### <u>EPROM (Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</u>

- Can be erased by exposing it to ultra-violet light for a duration of up to 40 min
- During programming, an electrical charge is trapped in an insulated gate region
- The charge is retained for more than 10 years because the charge has no leakage path
- For erasing this charge, ultra-violet light is passed through a quartz crystal window (lid)
- This exposure to ultra-violet light dissipates the charge
- During normal use, the quartz lid is sealed with a sticker

### <u>EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)</u>

- Programmed and erased electrically
- Can be erased and reprogrammed about ten thousand times
- Both erasing and programming take about 4 to 10 ms (millisecond)
- In EEPROM, any location can be selectively erased and programmed
- Can be erased one byte at a time, rather than erasing the entire chip &rrar; The process of reprogramming is flexible but slow

<br>

## Motherboard

- Backbone of a computer
- Serve as a single platform to connect all of the parts of a computer together
- Connect the CPU, memory, hard drives, optical drives, video card, sound card, and other ports and expansion cards directly or via cables

### <u>Motherboard Features</u>

Motherboard vary greatly in supporting various types of components

- A single type of CPU
- Few types of memories
- Video cards, hard disks, sound cards have to be compatible with the motherboard to function properly
- Motherboards, cases, and power supplies must be compatible to work properly together

### <u>Popular Manufacturers</u>

- Intel
- ASUS
- AOpen
- ABIT
- Biostar
- Gigabyte
- MSI

<br>

## Memory Unit

- A memory unit is the amount of data that can be stored in the storage unit
- The storage capacity is expressed in terms of Bytes

### <u>Main Memory Storage Units (Units of Memory)</u>

## Ports

- A port is a physical docking point using which an external device can be connected to the computer
- Can be programmatic docking point through which information flows from a program to the computer or over the Internet

### <u>Characteristics of Ports</u>

- External devices are connected to a computer using cables and ports
- Ports are slots on the motherboard into which a cable of external device is plugged in
- Examples of external devices attached via ports are the mouse, keyboard, monitor, microphone, speaker, etc

### <u>Types of Ports</u>

- Serial port
  - Used for external modems and older computer mice
  - Two versions: 9 pin, 25 pin model

  - Connect monitor to a computer's video card
  - It has 15 holes
  - Similar to the serial port connector, but while a serial port connector has pins, a VGA port has holes
- Power connector
  - Three-pronged plug
  - Connect to the computer's power cable that plugs into a power bar or wall socket
- Firewire port
  - Transfer large amount of data at very fast speed
  - Connect camcorders and video equipment to the computer
  - Data travels at 400 to 800 megabits per seconds
  - Invented by Apple
  - It has three variants: 4-Pin FireWire 400 connector, 6-Pin FireWire 400 connector, and 9-Pin FireWire 800 connector
- Modem port
  - Connect a PC's modem to the telephone network
- Ethernet port
  - Connect to a network and high speed Internet
  - Connect the network cable to a computer
  - This port resides on an Ethernet Card
  - Data travels at 10 megabits to 1000 megabits per seconds depending upon the network bandwidth
- Game port
  - Connect a joystick to a PC
  - Now replaced by USB
- Digital Video Interface (DVI port)
  - Connect Flat panel LCD monitor to the computer's high-end video graphic cards
  - Very popular among video card manufacturers
