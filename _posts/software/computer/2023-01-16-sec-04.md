## Software

- A set of instructions or programs instructing a computer to do specific tasks
- Software is a generic term used to describe computer programs
- Scripts, applications, programs, and a set of instructions &rarr; Often used to describe **Software**

<br>

## System Software

- System software is software designed to provide a platform for other software
- A collection of programs designed to operate, control, and extend the processing capabilities of the computer itself
- Generally prepared by the computer manufacturers
- Software products comprise of programs written in low-level languages, which interact with the hardware at a very basic level
- System Software serves as the interface between the hardware and the end users
- Examples:
  - Operating System (macOS, Linux, Android and Microsoft Windows)
  - Compilers
  - Interpreter
  - Assemblers
  - Software as a service application
  - [Firmware](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/firmware)
  - [Debugger](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/debugging)
  - [BIOS](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/BIOS-basic-input-output-system)

### <u>Features</u>

- Close to the system
- Fast in speed
- Difficult to design
- Difficult to understand
- Less interactive (Don't directly contact)
- Smaller in size
- Difficult to manipulate
- Generally written in <u>low-level language (&rarr; E.g. [Assembly Language](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assembly-language.asp))</u>
- Designed to run the devices complex programming
- Don't depend on Application Software

<br>

## Application Software

- Application software products are designed to satisfy a particular need of a particular environment
- All software applications prepared in the computer lab can come under the category of Application software
- May consist of a single program, such as Microsoft's notepad for writing and editing
- May consist of a collection of programs, such as a software package
- Examples:
  - Payroll Software
  - Student Record Software
  - Inventory Management Software
  - Income Tax Software
  - Railways Reservation Software
  - Microsoft Office Suite Software
  - Adobe Application Package
  - VS code
  - Visual Studio

### <u>Features</u>

- Close to the user
- Easy to design
- More interactive
- Slow in speed
- Generally written in high-level language
- Easy to understand
- Easy to manipulate and use
- Bigger in size and requires large storage space
