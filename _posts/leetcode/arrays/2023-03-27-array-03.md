# Problem

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

> Example 1:
>
> Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
> Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
> Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
> After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

> Example 2:
>
> Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
> Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?
